# About:::

<p>
This group project has been an exciting journey of teamwork and synergy, yet pushed us to further our knowledge boundaries and improve our skills. We embarked on this project by establishing effective communication channels and task management systems. To maximize our efficiency, we utilized a Trello board to track our progress and coordinated our efforts through GitHub commits.

And after a lot of work, we proudly present TerrorFlick: a React application designed to utilize our horror movie database for in-depth movie searches. Our aim is to provide users with an immersive experience, allowing them to search for their favorite horror films, and perhaps discover some new favorites as well!

## Instructions

 Navigate to the search bar: On the TerrorFlick homepage, you will find a search bar located at the top of the page.

<li>Enter your search query: Type the title, id, or title substring of the movie you are looking to find into the search bar. For example, you can search for "Dracula"</li>
<li>Click on the search button: Next to the search bar, there is a search button. Click on it or press Enter on your keyboard to initiate the search.</li>
<li>Browse the search results: TerrorFlick will display a list of movies related to your search query. Each movie item will have a thumbnail image, title and release year.</li>
<li>Click on movie: When you find a movie that interests you, click on its thumbnail or title. This will take you to the movie's dedicated page.</li>
<li>Show page: On the movie page, you will find more information about that movie, including a description, original language, release year, sub-genres, popularity rating (out of 10) as well as an option to edit that movie information, as well as to delete it.</li>
